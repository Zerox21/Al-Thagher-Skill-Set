# Implemented in v4

- Autosave + Resume attempt (server-side saved draft answers)
- CSV exports:
  - Chairman: attempts/students/teachers
  - Teacher: attempts/students
- Question approval workflow:
  - Teacher creates draft questions
  - Chairman approves drafts
  - Students see only approved questions
- Quick links moved to a top-bar tab style (role-based)

# Next recommended
- Item analytics: most missed questions per skill and per class
- Approval notifications (email/inside-app)
- Strict auto-submit at timeout server-side for abandoned attempts
- Stronger auth + password reset + audit log
